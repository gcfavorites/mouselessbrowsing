Thanks for all your feedback!
I've never dreamt to get so many feedback and have more than 1000 downsloads within 48 h. That's the best motivation to go on (even that wasn't my intention to do so ;-)
Yes, Paul this extension is worthless for people who like to use the mouse. That's alright. But if this extension helps only 10 people to browse in a better way it was worth the effort I invested (hopefully there are 10 ;-)
The criticism is justified. The ids should be visible immediately so you shouldn't have to wait untill the whole page is loaded. I'll try to figure out, if it's technically possible (it should be). I will also add the functionality to open a link in another tab (that's a good idea, thanks Xavier). 
To the problem, when the focus is on a field. In this case you have to press "Ctrl" while entering the id to trigger the action. But I think about another smarter solutions.


Mouseless Browsing means id-based browsing. Major goal of this extension is to enable browsing only by using the numpad keys.
How does it work:
Mouseless browsing marks every link and/or form element with an unique id. For following a link, focusing a textfield or pressing a button you only have to enter the appropriate id and confirm it with enter (you can also configure that the action is triggered automatically after a specified amount of time without pressing enter). If the focus is on a textfield, textarea or selectbox you have to press the CTRL-Key to avoid mixing up with the form entry while entering the id, the action is then triggered automatically.
Addionally you can configure keys for going back and forward in the history and for disabling mouseless browsing.
