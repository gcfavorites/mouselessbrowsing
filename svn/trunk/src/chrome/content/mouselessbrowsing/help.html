    <h3>What's new in Version 0.4 ...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Update to version 1.5 FF. <br>
                <b>Attention:</b> In FF 1.5 you can switch to a specific tab by pressing
                the ctrl-key and a number (0-9). In order to preserve the MLB functionality 
                to execute actions by pressing Ctrl + Id the tab-switch functionality of FF was
                overriden. As a substitution you can switch to a specific tab by pressing 
                "0" + tabnumber (1-9).
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now select a link by pressing a configurable postfix key (default: shift) 
                after you've entered the id. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Toogling the visibility of the ids were changed. Instead of double-press the
                configured key for showing the ids of <u>all</u> elements, you can now configure
                a seperate shortcut for doing this. Default is Ctrl + &lt;configured shortcut for toggling MLB on/off&gt;.
            </li>
            <li>
                The exclusive use of the numpad is now shown in the status bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                "00" has been inserted as the id for the web search field.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shortcuts for changing tabs were deleted. You can change tabs by pressing
                Ctrl+Page up/down and Ctrl+(Shift)+Tab.
            </li>
            <li>
                By automatically changing the the style of the links ("float:none" was added) misplacements 
                of the ids were further reduced (many thanks to Takayama Fumihiko)<br> The actual style for links is:<br>
                float:none;margin-left:2;z-index:500;font-size:xx-small;font-family:sans-serif;border-color:grey; border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;
            </li>
            <li>
                Interaction with the FF-Feature "Find by start typing" is fixed. If you have switched
                on this feature you also have to switch on the MLB-Feature "Use numpad exclusivly...".
                Then the popup of the searchbar will be suppressed for numpad-keys.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some minor Bugfixes were made.
            </li>
        </ul>

            
    <h3>How does it work...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mouseless browsing bases on marking all links, form elements and frames with ids. 
                If you do not like to see all of them, you can configure this in preferences dialog of MLB.
                You can trigger an action (e.g. following the link) by simply entering the id and 
                depending on the configuration confirming it by pressing Enter. 
                When the checkbox <nobr>"Execute automatically..."</nobr> is checked the action is automatically
                triggered after the specified delay for auto-execution.            
            </li>
            <li>
                You can configure to use the numpad exclusively for Mouseless Browsing.
                In that mode you can trigger actions even the focus is on a textfield or selectbox.
                The output is suppressed.
                If you not use the exclusive mode then triggering actions by typing ids 
                don't work if the focus is on a textfield or a selectbox.
                Entering the id while holding the <span class="configheader">CTRL-Key</span> triggers the action in any case.
                You can toggle between the two modes by pressing the num-key twice within 1 sec.
            </li>
            <li>
                Entering an id for a link results in navigate the browser to that link, entering
                an id for a form element results in clicking resp. selecting that form element. 
                Entering an id for a frame results in focusing the frame so you can scroll the content.
                The ids for frames are always place in the top left corner of the frame and they have a
                different background color.
            </li>
            <li>
                By default links are opened in the same tab. If you press the 
                <span class="configheader">ALT-key</span> while entering
                the id the link is opened in a new tab. The same happens when you press the 
                configurable postfix key (default: +) after you have typed in the id of the link.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you would like to select a link you have to press the configured postfix-key 
                (default: shift) after you've typed in the id of the link.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are also the following non-visible ids which you can enter: "0" focuses the address field,
                "00" the web search field and "0" + [1-9] activates the appropriate tab.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally there are shortcuts for navigating back an forth in the history (default: divide/multiply-keys)
                and for scrolling up/down (default: minus/plus)
            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        <span class="configheader">Enable Ids for form elements</span>

                Due to a bug in Firefox the numpad minus-key has the same key code as the
