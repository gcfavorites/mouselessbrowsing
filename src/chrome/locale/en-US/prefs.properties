mouselessbrowsing.initOnDomContentLoaded.help=If selected the ids will be visible before all images are loaded. 
mouselessbrowsing.disableAutomaticPageUpdateOnChange.help=Disables the automatic update of the ids after page changes caused by JavaScript functions. Disabling leads to missing ids in dynamic web applications like Gmail or Facebook.

mouselessbrowsing.executeAutomatic.help=If selected the appropriate action is triggered automatically after the specified delay for auto-execution (see next point). Otherwise you have to confirm the input by pressing enter.  
mouselessbrowsing.executeInstantlyWhenIdUnique.help=If selected the appropriate action is triggered instantly when the entered id is unique. E.g. if you enter "7" and there is no other element with id "70", "71" etc. MLB assumes the id is unique.\nATTENTION: This option generally prevents you from using postfix keys e.g. to open a link in a new tab!

mouselessbrowsing.idTypeCharSet.help=The defined characters are used for generating the ids. 
mouselessbrowsing.exclusiveNumpad.help=Input via the numpad is exclusively processed by MLB. I.e. even if the focus is on an text field the input via the numpad is interpreded as ids. There are two exceptions to this rule: First the Add- and the Subtract key is not blocked as the key codes for these keys are the same as the ones on the "normal" keyboard area. Second if the focus is on a select box the input could not be blocked at all.   
mouselessbrowsing.modifierForWritableElement.help=Specifies the modifier combination which allows to enter an id even the focus is in an text field (default is "Ctrl-Key"). When pressing this modifier the action is also executed automatically independently from preference to trigger an action automatically or not.\nAttention!

For text fields and image links the ids are positioned in the upper right corner of the element. For selectboxes the ids are placed over the arrow button. For other formelements the ids are positioned at the right margin of the element.\nEnabling smart positioning extends the time for initialization as some more calculations are necessary.  
mouselessbrowsing.omitSmartPosForCheckboxAndRadio.help=If selected no smart positioning for checkboxes and radio buttons will be applied which reduce the initialization time especially for pages with lists including checkboxes for every list item (e.g. Gmail).    
mouselessbrowsing.filterDuplicateLinks.help=If selected image links for which an identical text link exists will not be displayed, which reduce initialization time.
